# Notebooks for Computer Science
This page provides a guide to the Notebooks used in the coursecontains tutorials and exercises for the course on Computer Sciences of the Bsc in Engineering and Management at [EDEM](https://edem.es/). 
The course will cover two teaching units with this online book:
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Learn computer programming fundamentals with Python
- **Databases**: Learn the basics of database systems and structured query language programming

Each teaching unit contains:
- **Tutorials:** Follow along tutorials for each of the classes. 
- **Class Exercises:** Exercises to do during class to better understand the content. Class exercises **must** be submitted after every class.
- **Extra Exercises:** Extra exercises you can do prepare for the exam
