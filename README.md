# computer_science_tutorials
This project contains tutorials and exercises for the course on Computer Sciences of the Bsc in Engineering and Management at [EDEM](https://edem.es/). 
The course is organised in to the following folders: 
- **Tutorials:** Follow along tutorials for each of the classes. 
- **Class Exercises:** Exercises to do during class to better understand the content.
- **Extra Exercises:** Extra exercises you can do prepare for the exam
- **Class Examples:** Code snippets and examples used in class
