    "# RFID tag reader with Arduino\n",
    "This is a sample notebook containing some tips to read RFID tags with Arduino and controlling this remotely in Python. \n",
    "Our strategy is going to be based on the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We are going to use Python to manage all data and control the Arduino board. First we will use dictionaries to store the data and later we will update this to a database.\n",
    "- We will use the Arduino board to read the RFID tags and send the data to Python. We will only send the data when a new tag is read. \n",
    "- The Arduino board will be connected to the computer via USB.\n",
    "- We will use the serial port to communicate between Python and Arduino.\n",
    "- The Python code will basically do the following: \n",
    "- Send a message to the Arduino board to verify the connection. We will call this message \"handshake\".\n",
    "- Read the serial port and check if there is new data.\n",
    "- When there is new data, we will check if it is a \"handshake\" message or a tag ID.\n",
    "- If it is a tag ID, we will check if it is already in the database. If it is not, we will add it to the database. If it is, we will update the last time it was read.\n",
    "- We will check if the tag is assign to a person. If it is, we will send a message back to Arduino with the message. The Arduino will show this message in the LCD screen.\n",
