# Computer Programming for Engineering and Management

## Introduction
Welcome to the *Computer Programming for Engineering and Management* interactive book! This online book has been specifically designed to guide the course on Computer Programming [EDEM](https://edem.eu/en/>). The course is designed to build a specific set of computer programming skills that are becoming increasingly important in any engineering and/or management position.
Below you can find a more detailed table of contents, but for now, let's keep in mind what are the main objectives of the book are:

1. **Learn basic Python programming skills:** Get familiar with the Python environment (what do you need to develop code and what you need to execute your code) and learn the basics of Python programming language.
2. **Learn outstanding Python libraries for engineering and management:** This chapter covers Python libraries to solve engineering and management problems using Python, including applied mathematics, data manipulation and analysis, and visualization.
3. **Data Management and Structured Query Language (SQL):** Here you will what is a database and how to use the SQL language to query data in a database. This is a very powerful language, and although there are many different flavours and variations, most database engines used in in one way or another.

With this said, we are ready to get started! But before you do, I think it is important to emphasize that this is not a full-fledge computer programming book. It is an introductory book to the challenging computer programming world, meant for engineers and managers who want to use Python to solve problems, or that are involved in the development of software, for instance, providing specifications.

## Contributions

This book is currently being developed by a group of researchers and academics from different European Universities. Find below some words about the authors:

- **Universitat Politècnica de València**
   - [Francisco Fraile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscofraile/) "Hi, I am a senior researcher at the Research Center on Production Engineering and Management at UPV, and a passionate technomaniac who likes anything related to computer science. I teach computer science and operations research at EDEM and the main author of this book. I also like any sci-fi gender and I am prone to add easter eggs in my tutorials and exercises."
If you are a teacher and would like to contribute to this online book, please do not hesitate to contact me and I will be glad to discuss how to integrate your valuable input.
