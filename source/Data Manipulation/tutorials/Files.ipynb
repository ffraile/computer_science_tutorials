    "## Introduction\n",
    "Before we dive into data processing, let us discuss some common file formats used to store data, set the basic terminology and describe the main steps involved when dealing with data files in computer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic explanation of how Python read files\n",
    "At the end, a file is just a collection of bytes containing information for a specific purpose. In this Notebook, we will address different common file formats that contain information represented as **text**. Text files are composed of characters and organized in **lines**. In storage, characters need to be **encoded** into bytes. This process is called character encoding and each file may use a different character encoding, although your operating system will define a default character encoding to be used.\n",
    "Line breaks will be stored using a special character, and the end of the file will also be encoded as an special character.\n",
    "So basically, when reading a file in Python, we will read the contents line by line, until the end of file character is detected. But before we are able\n",

    "#### Opening files\n",
    "After this brief explanation, with no further ado, let´s start with practice. Copy the content of the next cell in a file using a text editor (a plain text editor like Notepad or TextEdit) and save it in a file named example.txt\n",

    "```text\n",
    "Hello,\n",
    "This is the first file to try in Python.\n",
    "Best luck!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you have saved it, you need to import it in your Python runtime. If you have opened this Notebook in Colabs, you need to open the lateral menu *Files* (the one with the folder 📁 icon), and either drag and drop the file in the area where the files and folders in your runtime are listed, or click on the button upload.\n",

This built-in method takes one argument with the location of the file you want to open, either **relative** to your Python script working directory, or **absolute**, from the root directory of your file system. You need to have permissions in your file system to open the file, otherwise this line might raise an error. Let us stop here for a minute to make these concepts clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are working on a Unix based file system (such as in Mac OS X or Google Colabs) and our Python script working directory is a folder called content in the root folder (the root folder for all files in the system). Imagine we want to open a file called example.txt which is stored in a folder called example1 within the content file, that is, our target file is organised as:\n",

    "content\n",
    "|-->example1\n",
    "    |--> example.txt\n",
    "...\n",

    "```python\n",
    "f = open('example1/example.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also use an absolute path to the file from the root folder, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('example1/example.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading lines\n",
    "The ```open()``` method returns a file object (assigned to variable ```f``` in the example), which has a ```readline()``` method that returns a string with the context of the next line (the first line after calling open and subsequent lines thereafter), until the end-of-file character is detected, in which case, an empty string is returned. In the example, we assign the result to the variable ```line``` in a while loop. Since an empty string evaluates to false, the example prints the file line by line and exists the loop when the end of the file is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the method ```close()``` to close the file. In practice, closing the file makes sure that the runtime keeps track of which files are open by which applications and takes measures to avoid inconsistencies (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some examples, you may find that the file is opened using the keyword ```with```, as in the following example:\n"

    "By default, files are opened with mode 'rt' or 'r' which is equivalent, so what we can only read lines in the file, and do not write to it. The mode 'w' allows us to write in the file, using the ```write()``` method, but first it *truncates* the file, meaning that in practice we will overwrite its contents. If we do not want to override the contents of the file, we can either use mode 'a' (to append content after the last line of the file), or mode 'r+', to read the file from the beginning and being able to modify each line with ```write()``` before reading new lines.\n",

However, you are already familiar with JSON since as previously described when covering iterables: it is the same notation used to define [dictionaries in Python](https://programming.engineeringcodehub.com/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Iterable%20Objects%20II.html#Dictionaries).

    "```\n",
    "In this example, the data collects records of temperature and humidity readings, with four columns, a data column containing the date of the reading, a time column containing the time of the reading, and read temperature and humidity. Normally, csv files use the *.csv file extension.\n",
    "Note that the first row is a header row, used to facilitate the use of the file by humans.\n",

    "Now, using the skills you gained from the previous section, can you make a Python script to read this file and calculate the average temperature? Save the contents of the cell below in a file named exercise1.csv and use the examples above the read its contents.\n",

    "Although the name states that fields are separated by commas, but you can use other field separators. Another common field separator is the tabulation, as in the following example:\n",

    "DATE TIME TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY\n",
    "2022-08-31 00:15 25.5 65\n",

    "2022-08-31 01:15 25.5 65\n",

    "Note that instead of commas, we have used tabulations (special character ```\"\\t\"```).
