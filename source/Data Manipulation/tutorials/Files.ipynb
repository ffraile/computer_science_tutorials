    "\n",
    "### Basic explanation of how Python read files\n",
    "At the end, a file is just a collection of bytes containing information for a specific purpose. In this Notebook, we will address different common file formats that contain information represented as **text**. Text files are composed of characters and organized in **lines**. In storage, characters need to be **encoded** into bytes. This process is called character encoding and each file may use a different character encoding, although your operating system will define a default character encoding to be used.\n",
    "Line breaks will be stored using a special character, and the end of the file will also be encoded as an special character.\n",
    "So basically, when reading a file in Python, we will read the contents line by line, until the end of file character is detected. But before we are able\n",

    "#### Opening files\n",

    "Once you have saved it, you need to import it in your Python runtime.

    "Note that we used the built-in function ```open()``` to open the file. This built-in method takes one argument with the location of the file you want to open, either **relative** to your Python script working directory, or **absolute**, from the root directory of your file system. You need to have permissions in your file system to open the file, otherwise this line might raise an error. Let us stop here for a minute to make these concepts clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are working on a Unix based file system (such as in Mac OS X or Google Colabs) and our Python script working directory is a folder called content in the root folder (the root folder for all files in the system). Imagine we want to open a file called example.txt which is stored in a folder called example1 within the content file, that is, our target file is organised as:\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "content\n",
    "|-->example1\n",
    "    |--> example.txt\n",
    "...\n",

    "Since the working directory is content, relative to the working directory, the file is located in the following url:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('example1/example.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also use an absolute path to the file from the root folder, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('example1/example.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading lines\n",
    "The ```open()``` method returns a file object (assigned to variable ```f``` in the example), which has a ```readline()``` method that returns a string with the context of the next line (the first line after calling open and subsequent lines thereafter), until the end-of-file character is detected, in which case, an empty string is returned. In the example, we assign the result to the variable ```line``` in a while loop. Since an empty string evaluates to false, the example prints the file line by line and exists the loop when the end of the file is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the method ```close()``` to close the file. In practice, closing the file makes sure that the runtime keeps track of which files are open by which applications and takes measures to avoid inconsistencies (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some examples, you may find that the file is opened using the keyword ```with```, as in the following example:\n"

The mode 'w' allows us to write in the file, using the ```write()``` method, but first it *truncates* the file, meaning that in practice we will overwrite its contents. If we do not want to override the contents of the file, we can either use mode 'a' (to append content after the last line of the file), or mode 'r+', to read the file from the beginning and being able to modify each line with ```write()``` before reading new lines.\n",

    "### JSON\n",
    "JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, since it is the notation used to define objects in this another popular programming language. Let us take a look at the concepts in the JSON acronym:\n",
    "- J is for Javascript, which is another very popular programming language.\n",
    "- S is for Serial. Serializing is the process of readying a variable piece by piece so that it can be stored in a file or sent over a communication media (for instance serial communication).\n",
    "- O is for Object. Objects is another word for variables\n",
    "- N is for Notation, which is an agreed syntax to represent an object in written form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so, putting the pieces together, JSON is a notation or syntax defined to store variables in files in an organized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON syntax is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curve brackets**: Are used to specify the beginning ```{``` and end ```}``` of an object.\n",
    "- **Comma separated list of key-value pairs**: Within the curve brackets, we need to specify the attributes or properties of the object. We will use what is called Key-Value pairs. The Key is the identifier (normally the name) of each individual attribute of the object, and the value is the value it takes.\n",
    "- **Colon-separated Key-Value pairs**: We will use ```:`` to map each attribute with its corresponding value using.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a JSON object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\":\"Wilson\",\n",
    "    \"surname\":\"Fisk\",\n",
    "    \"alias\":\"Kingpin\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 49\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this object has 4 attributes, *keyed* name, surname, alias, and age. We can assign numeric or text values (actually, we could also use numbers as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it seem famliar? Indeed, you are already familiar with JSON since as previously described when covering iterables: it is the same notation used to define [dictionaries in Python](https://programming.engineeringcodehub.com/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Iterable%20Objects%20II.html#Dictionaries). So, in a way, with JSON, we are just writing down Python dictionaries into files. There are however two important differences between Python dictionaries notation and the JSON file format that need to be accounted for. First, that you must always use double quotation marks, as **single quotation marks** are not allowed. Also, unlike Python dictionary keys, **JSON field names must always be double-quoted strings**.\n",

    "In this activity, we will extend the Python script of the IoT challenge template [available here](iiot_challenge/templates/python_part/script_template.py) to log data received from the Arduino to a CSV file. This data can be analyzed later for trends, helping with decision-making in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement this data logging functionality as an additional option called continuous mode. The image below illustrate how the continuous mode works\n",
    "\n",
    "![Continuous mode](./img/Serial_Communication_Continuous_Mode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we will send commands to the Arduino device to read sensor data, and whenever we collect new data, we will print it to the console, but also put in a dictionary, that we will later save into a CSV file. In this mode, we will repeat these steps in an endless loop, so we will send information back and forth in the serial without the need to get input from the user. All the information will be stored in the file, and we will be able to use this data for analysis.\n",
    "This mode has the advantage that we can collect data from the device without the need to send a user command to the device every time we want to read the sensors. This is useful when we want to collect data from the device for a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
