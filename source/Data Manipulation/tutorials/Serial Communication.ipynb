    "# Control of external devices using serial connection\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial delves into the control of external devices using serial connection. The serial connection is a communication protocol that allows the communication between two devices. It is widely used in the industry, and it is a very useful tool to build proofs of concepts and early prototypes, particuarly in combination with platforms like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) or [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). In many applications, computers are used as a **bridge** to connect external devices to the world, providing for instance enhanced processing capabilities, better user interfaces, and Internet connectivity. This simple paradigm is called **computer-aided control**, it is widely used in the industry, and it is one of the main pillars of the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) (IoT).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "Since this tutorial is focused on the control of external devices, it is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge on electronics and microcontrollers. In particular, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to run the code in a computer with Python. Unfortunately, platforms like Google Colabs will not work, because they are executing in the cloud and do not have serial communication with your connected devices. So, you need to use your computer, and make sure you have previously installed Python and Visual Code and that you are familiar with the Visual Code environment, following these tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python Environment](https://computer-science-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Setting%20up%20your%20environment.html)\n",
    "-  [Visual Code Hello World](https://computer-science-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Hello%20World.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install the [pyserial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html) library. You can install it by opening the terminal and typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyserial\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or using Visual Code's GUI terminal as explained in the tutorial. You can download the code for this tutorial from [here](./iiot_challenge/serial_communication.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The image below shows the strategy that we will use to communicate to the Arduino device using a serial connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, we will use Python üêç teaming up with the mighty Arduino üõ†Ô∏è, the master of sensing and controlling the physical world!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's our strategy: The user will use the terminal to type in a command, and Python will send it to Arduino using the serial device, which is basically a USB cable. Arduino will then read the command and do its thing. For example, If the command is to read the temperature, üå° Arduino will read the temperature and send it back to Python. Back in Python, we will show this information to the user in the terminal.  So, in summary, we are going to use the USB cable to send messages as if it was a good old land-line üìû.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Serial Communication Strategy](./img/Serial_Communication_strategy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how does this work? Well, it's actually pretty simple. In Python, we will use ```input()``` to ask the user for a command. Then, we will use the ```serial``` library to send the command to Arduino (specifically the ```serial.write()``` method). And, once we get the information back from Arduino, we will print it using ```print()```. This way the user will use the Python script in the terminal to chat with Arduino. ü§ìüí¨\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we send the command to Arduino, we need to make sure that the command is ready for Arduino to receive it. So, we will encode the command with the ```.encode('UTF-8')``` string method. This method will convert the command into a format that Arduino can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Arduino receives the command, it will read it using the ```Serial.read()``` method. Then, it will do its thing. For example, if the command is to read the temperature, it will read the temperature and send it back to Python using the ```Serial.write()``` method. It will terminate the message with the end-of-line character ```\\n```. This way, Python will know when the message is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Python receives the message, it will decode it using the ```.decode('UTF-8')``` string method. Then, it will print the message using the ```print()``` method. We will be able to see the message in the terminal. Later on, we can use other methods to process the message. For example, we can use the ```split()``` method to split the message into different parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, buckle up, and let's get this party started! With Python and Arduino, we are going to make magic! üé©‚ú® The next sections of the tutorial provide a step-by-step guide to implement the strategy using a simple example.\n",

    "To test the code below, you need to have an actual device to control. In this tutorial, we will use an Arduino board connected to the device using a USB port. The Arduino board will be connected to different sensors that measure the temperature and humidity of the environment.

The baud rate is the number of symbols that can be transmitted per second. The higher the baud rate, the faster the communication. The maximum baud rate is 115200, but we will use 9600 in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```Serial.read()```: This function reads a string from the serial port. It is important to note that the string is read as a sequence of characters, so we need to convert it to the desired data type. In this tutorial, we will use the ```int()``` function to convert the string to an integer. We will use this function to read the user input from the computer.\n",

In this mode, we will repeat these steps in an endless loop, so we will send information back and forth in the serial without the need to get input from the user. All the information will be stored in the file, and we will be able to use this data for analysis.\n",
