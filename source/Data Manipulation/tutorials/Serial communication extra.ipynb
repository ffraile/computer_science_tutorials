    "Basically, we will send the commands to the device and whenever we collect new data, we will print it to the console, but also put in a dictionary, that we will later save into a JSON file. In this mode, we will repeat these steps in an endless loop, so we will send information back and forth in the serial without the need to get input from the user. All the information will be stored in the file, and we will be able to use this data for analysis.\n",
    "This mode has the advantage that we can collect data from the device without the need to send a command to the device every time we want to read the sensors. This is useful when we want to collect data from the device for a long period of time.\n",
