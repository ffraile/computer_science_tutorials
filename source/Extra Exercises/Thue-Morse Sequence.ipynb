    "The Thue Morse Sequence is a binary sequence that is generated by negating (binary complement) the bits in the sequence so far, and adding the resulting bits to the sequence, starting with 0. That is, the sequence is:\n",

    "0110,\n",
    "01101001,\n",
    "...\n",
    "Notice that the new bits added in every sequence step are the binary complement of the sequence. You can find more information about the Thue-Morese Sequence [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence).\n",
