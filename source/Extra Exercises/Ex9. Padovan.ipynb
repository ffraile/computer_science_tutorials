    "The Padovan sequence is the following infinite sequence of natural numbers:\n",
    "`1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 7 9 12 16 21 28 37 ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence begins with the subsquence $[1, 1, 1]$ and then each term is the sum of two terms before the last one, that is:\n",

    "P(0) = 1\n",

    "The Padovan sequence is a cousin of the Fibonacci sequence and has many applications in applied mathematics. As a curiosity, the Padovan sequence can be represented as a set of joined equilateral triangles forming an spiral:\n",

    "Recall that in Python, the last elements of the array can be accessed directly using negative indices, for example, `array[-1]` would be the last element of the array, `array [-2]` the second to last, and so on. Also, remember that the `append()` function, adds an element to the end of the array. So for example, we could generate a Padovan sequence with 4 elements as:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pad = [1, 1, 1]\n",
    "next_val = pad[-2] + pad[-3]\n",
    "pad.append(next_val)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Also, in Python, you can use the `while` loop to iterate while a certain condition is not met. We can use this type of loop to generate a Padovan sequence with a \n",
    "given length, using the ```len``` function in the condition to compare the length of the array with a specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "With everything explained so far, **develop the following program**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A program that asks the user for a length and generates a Padovan sequence of that length, stores it in an array and prints the array. "
