    "If we have an equation in the form **a**x<sup>2</sup> + **b**x + **c** = 0, to solve **x** the following formula is applied:\n",

    "In Python, recall that multiplication is done with an asterisk \\* while power is indicated by two \\*\\*. For example, 2\\*3 is 6 y 2\\*\\*3 is 8.\n",

    "The square root can be calculated using ```1/2``` as the right operand of the power operator, for instance ```4**(1/2)``` will equal 2.\n",

    "To ask a user to enter data, the `input()` function is used. This function admits as a parameter a text that will be shown to the user as an aid to request the input data. For example,\n",
    "`text = input(\"Enter a text: \")`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the entered text to be treated as an integer in order to perform mathematical operations, we must convert it using the `int()` function. This is also called **casting**. For example,\n",
    "`number = int(input(\"Enter an integer number: \")`\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, with all the previous explanation, **develop the following program**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A program to calculate the solution to a quadratic equation like ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0. It will ask the user for the values of a, b and c, calculate x (possibly have 2 solutions) and print the result on the screen.\n",
