    "# Chatbot\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as the ability of a digital computer to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, like visual perception, speech recognition or chatting. A chatbot is a piece of software that may use AI and can interact with humans and keep a basic chat or conversation, very useful in companies to automate interactions with customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you run a company that sells digital devices like smartphones or computers, and you want to automate the customer service in your web. Let’s create a chatbot!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction and welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the bot has to ask the user’s name. Then, the user will input his/her name. Since we want a polite bot, the bot must print “Hello, {name}!” being {name} the name the user has input before. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bot:\t- Welcome, what’s your name?\n",
    "User:\t- Peter\n",
    "Bot:\t- Hello, Peter!\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Listening to user’s requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot will then ask “What do you want to know?” and wait for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available commands that user can input are the following:\n",
    "- “the price of a product”\n",
    "- “the stock of a product”\n",
    "- “goodbye”\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the command, the bot will perform different actions (see Point 3). After the action, the bot must start over asking again “What do you want to know?” and wait for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour is repeated in a loop except if the user input is “goodbye”. In this case, the bot will say “Goodbye, {name}!” and exit the program (being {name} the name the user has input in the introduction, see Point 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replying customer’s inquires.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the command input by the user is either “the price of a product” or “the stock of a product”, the bot must ask “Which product?” and wait for user to input one of these products: computer, smartphone, laptop, tablet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the user response, the bot will anser with the required information attending to this table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Products\tPrice\tStock\n",
    "computer\t1500\t3\n",
    "smartphone\t900\t7\n",
    "laptop\t1250\t4\n",
    "tablet\t400\t5\n",
    "```\n",
    "After the action, the bot must start over asking again “What do you want to know?” and wait for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bot:\t- What do you want to know?\n",
    "User:\t- the price of a product\n",
    "Bot:\t- Which product?\n",
    "User:\t- smartphone\n",
    "Bot:\t- The price of a smartphone is 900 euros.\n",
    "Bot:\t- What do you want to know?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bot:\t- What do you want to know?\n",
    "User:\t- the stock of a product\n",
    "Bot:\t- Which product?\n",
    "User:\t- tablet\n",
    "Bot:\t- The stock of the tablet is 5 units.\n",
    "Bot:\t- What do you want to know?\n",
    "```\n",
    "TIP: In order to store the product information, you may use arrays. However, Python dictionaries should be more efficient and neat in this case. For example, for two products:\n",
    "```\n",
    "products = {\n",
    "    \"computer\": {\n",
    "        \"price\": 1500,\n",
    "        \"stock\": 3\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"smartphone\": {\n",
    "        \"price\": 900,\n",
    "        \"stock\": 7\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "And for printing the information in the dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(products[\"computer\"][\"price\"])\n",
    "print(products[\"smartphone \"][\"stock\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you use this example, remember to add laptop and tablet information!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the bot asks for user input, if the user input is none of the commands described in Point 2, the bot must answer “Sorry, I don’t understand” and start over again and continue listening to user’s requests by asking “What do you want to know?” and waiting for another user input.\n"
