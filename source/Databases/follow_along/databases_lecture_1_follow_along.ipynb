    "## Objectives\n",
    "The main objectives of this lecture are:\n",
    "\n",
    "️⃣1️⃣ Get familiar with databases key concepts and data modelling\n",
    "2️⃣ Get familiar with the practice environment (MySQL)\n",
    "3️⃣ Practice with SQL creation and insertion commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key concepts\n",
    "In a relational database, data is going to be organised in **tables**.  The key concepts are summarised as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept      | Represents                                       | Implemented as   |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Entity       | Type of real-world concept or object of interest | Table            |\n",
    "| attribute    | A property of interest of a concept              | Column           |\n",
    "| instance     | An individual concept or object of interest      | Row              |\n",
    "| Identifiers  | Attribute that uniquely identifies an instance   | Primary keys (1) |\n",
    "| Relationship | an association among two or more entities        | Foreign keys (2) |\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary keys:** A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values uniquely identify a row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign keys:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values correspond to the values of the primary key in another table.\n",
    "In order to add a row with a given foreign key value, there must exist a row in the related table with the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let´s see these in action with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic structure of a model (e-commerce example)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic structure of a database model for an e-commerce\n",
    "\n",
    "![Basic relational model](../tutorials/img/Basic_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent each concept or object in our database as a different entity, and in the model diagram, each entity is going to be represented as a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed model of an entity\n",
    "If we *zoom* into the model to see with greater detail one of the entities, we would see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![entities in basic model](../tutorials/img/Basic_model_entity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entity box in the model will contain the names of each of the columns or fields (data of interest) of the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "They are called relational models for a reason! Relationships are a very important aspect in life, and also in databases, as we will use these associations between tables to get valuable insights from our data! Let us use the same e-commerce example to illustrate key concepts around relationships.\n",
    "##### Cardinality Ratio: Maximum instances that can participate in a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-to-Many [1:N]:** ```A+---<B``` A record in table A can relate to many records in table B (For instance, a customer can make many payments). A record in Table A can relate to many records in Table B (For instance, the same customer can make different payments for different products). This is the most common type of relationship in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-to-One [1:1]:** A record in Table A relates to at most one record in Table B, and a record in table B relates to at most record in Table B. This type of relationship is represented as ```A+--+B```. This is less common (For instance, imagine that we had the products in our e-commerce were unique. I this is the case, a product could one be purchased once, and the relationship between product and payment would be [1:1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is one more type of relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Many-to-Many [M:N]:** Each record in table A can relate to many records in table B and each record in table B can relate to more than one record in table A. Many-to-Many relationships are represented as: ```A>---<B```. In practice, as we will see, we will not be able to implement this type of relationship without using an intermediate table, or junction table. For instance, imagine that our e-commerce is a supermarket and thus a customer could buy the same product, say milk, several times. The relationship between the product milk and the customer would be [M:N], but it is an indirect relationship that is implemented through the (junction) table payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the symbols, above, our model is now:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/relationships_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Participation\n",
    "The minimum cardinality, or participation, is the minimum number of entity instances that must participate in a relationship. The participation can be mandatory or optional. If mandatory, it means that at least 1 entity must participate in the relationship. For instance, the participation of customer in the relationship ```Customer>---+Payment``` is mandatory, because 1 payment must be made by one customer (and only one). However, the participaton of Payment may be optional, if, for instance we could also have potential customers in our customer table. We will use symbols under each end of the relationship as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If 1 (symbol |), participation in the relationship by the entity is mandatory, i.e. at least one entity instance must participate in the relationship.\n",
    "- If 0 (symbol 0), participation in the relationship by the entity is optional, i.e. no entity instance must participate in the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you got this right, let us practice with the following relationships!\n",
