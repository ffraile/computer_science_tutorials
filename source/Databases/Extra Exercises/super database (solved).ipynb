    "You are building a database for a 'fandom' website. The objective is to store in a database the information about superheroes in different comics across different comics. \n",
    "You want to store basic details about the following entities: \n",
    "- Comic editorial: name, and head-quarters (e.g. Marvel, New York), \n",
    "- Authors: Full name, role (either writer or artist), \n",
    "- Comic: Name, issue, publication date (e.g. Avengers, 1, 1963-09-20), \n",
    "- Super-Hero: Real name, fictional name (e.g. Peter Parker, Spiderman)\n",
    "- Super-hero squad: Name (e.g. Avengers) \n",
    "- Super powers: Name, description (e.g. super-strength, ability to kick ass bad time)\n",
    "\n",
    "You also want to implement in your model, meaningful relationships to connect the different entities, for instance, which editorial publishes each comic, which are the authors of the comic, in which issues does every super hero appear, or what super-powers do they have. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Authorship:** Junction table to implement the (many-to-many) relationship between Authors and Comics (A comic can have more than one author and an author more than one comic). \n",
    "- **Affiliation:** Junction table to implement the  (many-to-many) relationship between Super-heroes and Squads (A super-hero can join more than one squad and there is probably no squad with more than one super-hero).\n",
    "- **Appearance:** Junction table to implement the  (many-to-many) relationship between Super-heroes and Comics (A super-hero can appear in more than one comic and several heroes can appear in the same comic issue, otherwise they are no fun).\n",
    "- **Super-Empowerment:** Junction table to implement the  (many-to-many) relationship between Super-heroes and Super Powers (A super-hero can have more than one super-power, and several heroes may have the same super-power)\n",
    "\n",
    "These junction tables allow us to define the many-to-many relationships, but we can also add new fields to these records to store and analyse the properties of these relationships."
