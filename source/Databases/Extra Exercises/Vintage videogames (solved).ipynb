    "# Vintage Video Game Store Database\n",
    "## Problem definition\n",
    "Imagine you're designing a database for a small e-commerce store that specializes in selling vintage video games. The store has several products for sale, each of which has a unique product ID, a name, a description, a price, and a list of compatible gaming platforms (for instance, GameBoy, or PlayStation). The store also has several customers, each of whom has a unique customer ID, a name, an email address, a shipping address, and a list of orders they have placed. Each order can contain one or more products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a database to represent this information. Your database should include tables for products, platforms, customers, orders, and order items. In the order items table, you should keep track of the quantity of each product that was ordered. Make sure to include appropriate fields of interest and foreign keys for each entity, considering the following additional requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The store has a limited inventory of each product, so the number of available copies for each product should be tracked.\n",
    "- Each product has a rarity rating, which is a value between 1 and 10 that indicates how rare the product is.\n",
    "- The store has a rewards program for its customers. Customers can earn points by making purchases, and they can redeem these points for discounts on future purchases. Each point is worth $0.01.\n",
    "- The store also wants to keep track of which employees have worked on each order. The employees are identified by their first name, last name, and employee ID.\n"

    "Here is a description of each table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `products` table stores information about each product. The `product_id` field is the primary key, and the `name`, `description`, `price`, `rarity_rating`, and `inventory_count` fields are all required. The `rarity_rating` field is an integer between 1 and 10 coming from the additional requirements, and the `inventory_count` field is an integer that represents the number of copies of the product that are currently in stock.\n",
    "- The `platforms` table stores information about each gaming platform. The `platform_id` field is the primary key, and the `name` field is required.\n",
    "- The `products_platforms` table stores information about which platforms each product is compatible with. This table is necessary because there is a Many to Many ([N:N]) relationship between products and platforms (a game can be available in different platforms and conversely a platform can support  different games). The `product_id` and `platform_id` fields are both foreign keys that reference the `product_id` and `platform_id` fields in the `products` and `platforms` tables, respectively. Additionally, the `product_id` and `platform_id` fields together form the primary key for this table. We could also define a different primary key for this table, but it's not necessary since the combination of the `product_id` and `platform_id` fields is already unique.\n",
    "- The `customers` table stores information about each customer. The `customer_id` field is the primary key, and the `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `shipping_address` fields are all required.\n",
    "- The `orders` table stores information about each order. The `order_id` field is the primary key, and the `customer_id`, `employee_id`, and `order_date` fields are all required. The `customer_id` field is a foreign key that references the `customer_id` field in the `customers` table.\n",
    "- The `order_items` table stores information about each product that is included in each order. The `order_id` and `product_id` fields are both foreign keys that reference the `order_id` and `product_id` fields in the `orders` and `products` tables, respectively. The `order_id` and `product_id` fields together form the primary key for this table.\n",
    "- The `employees` table stores information about each employee. The `employee_id` field is the primary key, and the `first_name` and `last_name` fields are both required.\n",
    "- The `rewards` table stores information about each reward that a customer has earned. The `reward_id` field is the primary key, and the `order_id` and `points` fields are both required. The `order_id` field is a foreign key that references the `order_id` field in the `orders` table, so that we can keep track of which order the reward was earned from.\n",
    "- The `rewards_program_redemptions` table stores information about each redemption of rewards program points. The `redemption_id` field is the primary key, and the `reward_id`, `redemption_date`, and `points_redeemed` fields are all required. The `reward_id` field is a foreign key that references the `reward_id` field in the `rewards` table.\n",
