# Data storage, retrieval and representation

Welcome to this chapter on data storage, retrieval, and representation! In this chapter, we will learn about databases, how to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to query data from a database, and how to make beautiful graphics and dashboards with these data. 
SQL  is a very powerful language, and although there are many different flavours and variations, most data intensive applications use it in one way or another.
Moreover, database storage, retrieval, and data representation form the backbone of modern engineering and management applications. 
In management and engineering projects, databases store critical information, as we have already explained that data is the raw material to develop engineering models and calculations. 
The ability to rapidly retrieve and manipulate data can directly impact the speed and efficiency of data-driven decision-making. 
Moreover, proper data representation ensures that complex business metrics are easily understandable, allowing for agile decision-making and strategic planning.
