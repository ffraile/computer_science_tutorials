    "## Aggregate functions\n",
    "Aggregate functions are functions that operate on a set of values across different records. \n",
    "For instance, the function average returns the average of the value passed as argument. We can use this function in our query as with data type functions. Look at the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(amount) \n",
    "FROM payments WHERE customerNumber = 103;\n",
    "|-------------+\n",
    "| avg(amount) |\n",
    "|-------------+\n",
    "| 7438.120000 |\n",
    "|-------------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used a select query with the ```AVG``` function to calculate the average of the payment amount, and the result is the average amount paid among all payments registered in the table. Each database engine provides a different set of aggregate functions. The table below is extracted from the official MySQL documentation and describes some of the most relevant aggregate functions available:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| AVG() |Return the average value of the argument |\n",
    "| COUNT() | Return a count of the numb  of rows returned |\n",
    "| GROUP_CONCAT() | Return a concatenated string |\n",
    "| MAX() | Return the maximum value |\n",
    "| MIN() | Return the minimum value |\n",
    "| STD() | Return the population standard deviation |\n",
    "| SUM()\t| Return the sum |\n",
    "| VARIANCE() | Return the population standard variance |\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, aggregate functions ignore NULL values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that most of the functions provide statistical properties of the values passed as parameters, and consequently, they make sense primarily for numeric arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For temporal values such as datetime or timestamp, ```MAX``` and ```MIN``` provide the minimum and maximum date values. The SUM() and AVG() aggregate functions do not work with temporal values, and you should use other data type functions to convert to a numeric value first. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "# Calculate the sum of seconds in a timestamp column\n",
    "SELECT SEC_TO_TIME(SUM(TIME_TO_SEC(time_col))) FROM tbl_name;\n",
    "# Calculate the sum of days in a datetime column\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### AVG([DISTINCT] expr) \n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the average value of expr. The DISTINCT option can be used to return the average of the distinct values of expr.\n",

    "SELECT AVG(amount) \n",
    "    FROM payments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### COUNT(expr) \n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a count of the number of non-NULL values of expr in the rows retrieved by a SELECT statement. The result is a BIGINT value.\n",

    "If there are no matching rows, COUNT() returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*)\n",
    "    FROM student\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```COUNT(*)``` is somewhat different in that it returns a count of the number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```COUNT(DISTINCT) ``` on the other hand returns a count of the number of rows with different non-NULL expr values. If there are no matching rows, ```COUNT(DISTINCT)``` returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GROUP_CONCAT()\n",
    "This function returns a string result with the concatenated non-NULL values from a group. It returns NULL if there are no non-NULL values. The full syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] expr [,expr ...]\n",
    "             [ORDER BY {unsigned_integer | col_name | expr}\n",
    "                 [ASC | DESC] [,col_name ...]]\n",
    "             [SEPARATOR str_val])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    GROUP_CONCAT(comments SEPARATOR ';')\n",
    "    FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "As shown in the full syntax, duplicated values can be eliminated using the DISTINCT clause. To sort values in the result, use the ORDER BY clause. To sort in reverse order, add the DESC (descending) keyword to the name of the column you are sorting by in the ORDER BY clause. The default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using the ASC keyword. The default separator between values in a group is comma (,). To specify a separator explicitly, use SEPARATOR followed by the string literal value that should be inserted between group values. To eliminate the separator altogether, specify SEPARATOR ''.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MAX()\n",
    "Returns the maximum value of expr. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no matching rows, MAX() returns NULL.\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### MIN()\n",
    "Returns the minimum value of expr. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no matching rows, MIN() returns NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MIN(amount), MAX(amount)\n",
    "       FROM Payments;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STD()\n",
    "Returns the population standard deviation of expr. STD() is a synonym for the standard SQL function STDDEV_POP(), provided as a MySQL extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no matching rows, STD() returns NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MIN(amount), MAX(amount), STD(amount)\n",
    "       FROM Payments;\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### SUM()\n",
    "Returns the sum of expr. If the return set has no rows, SUM() returns NULL. The DISTINCT keyword can be used to sum only the distinct values of expr.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no matching rows, SUM() returns NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VARIANCE()\n",
    "Returns the population standard variance of expr. VARIANCE() is a synonym for the standard SQL function VAR_POP(), provided as a MySQL extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no matching rows, VARIANCE() returns NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GROUP BY  \n",
    "The ```GROUP BY``` clause groups rows according to the provided conditions to group the result of the aggregate functions to group the results into subsets. \n",
    "For instance, in the example below, we calculated the average amount across all payments, but imagine that we are interested in knowing the average amount per customer. \n",
