    "# Test Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hosted MySQL and Workbench\n",
    "In the long-term, the best alternative is to have MySQL installed in your own PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installer for Microsoft Windows\n",
    "You can download the Installer for Microsoft Windows from this link:\n",
    "\n",
    "[MS Windows Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the lightweight installer (around 2.3Mb), and click Download. You do not need to create an Oracle account, click\n",
    "on \"No thanks, just start my Download\" instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the installer, you will have to provide administration privileges to make changes in your computer. Select the\n",
    "**Developer configuration option**, that will install both MySQL service and MySQL Workbench in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions, eventually you will be asked to select the encryption method. Select the \"Use Legacy\n",
    "Encryption\" method recommended for a test environment.\n",
    "You will also be asked to enter a password for the user root, enter a password for the service.\n",
    "When the installation is completed, you can launch the services control panel app to check whether your service is up\n",
    "and running, just look for \"Services\" in your language in windows and look for the MySQL service and make sure it is\n",
    "started. You may shut it down when you are not using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installer for Mac OS X\n",
    "Download the installer for MAC OS from this link:\n",
    "\n",
    "[MAC OS Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/macos-installation-pkg.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the installation steps, just as in windows, eventually you will be asked to select the encryption method. Select the \"Use Legacy\n",
    "Encryption\" method recommended for a test environment.\n",
    "You will also be asked to enter a password for the user root, enter a password for the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation is completed, the service is available in your platform. Note that, if you chose to not start\n",
    "MySQL, you will need to enter launchctl from the command line or start MySQL by clicking \"Start\" using the MySQL\n",
    "preference pane to start it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should install MySQL Workbench as well, using the info in this link:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing-mac.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you installed it, as in Windows, create a connection to your local service, making sure it is started! Use the\n",
    "password you set during the installation process and you are ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a connection to a database serer in MySQL Workbench\n",
    "Now, you can look for and open Workbench in your system. When you open the application for the first time, MySQL will show the **Home tab** which contains the preconfigured connections. You will need to configure a connection to a database on a new installation. Click on the plus icon besides **MySQL connection** to add a new connection. You should have a connection to a local server:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MySQL workbench](../img/mysql_workbench.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the host is set to *localhost* (as you know, your computer), the port is set to 3306, and the user is set to *root*. If you have not changed the default settings during the installation, you can leave them as they are. Enter the password you configured during the installation process, and you are good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic operations in MySQL Workbench\n",
    "We will mainly use the Visual SQL editor in workbench. The user manual for MySQL Workbench is available [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-sql-editor.html). We encourgage you to read it, but we will summarize the basic operations here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as depicted in the following screenshot (from the official docs), the SQL editor is divided into different parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MySQL visual editor](./img/wb-visual-sql-editor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts that we will use according to this diagram are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigator Sidebar panel.** The Navigator sidebar panel allows us to navigate through the different databases (or schemas) and tables in our database. The database in use is shown in **bold**. We can drop down the database to see the tables in the database. We can also drop down the tables to check the details (columns, indexes, foreign keys, etc.), and if we right click, we can edit the table or edit the data in the table, by clicking on **Select Rows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SQL Editor.** This is the main part of the screen, where we can write our queries. To execute our queries, we need to click on the **lightning icon** in the top bar, to execute the selected query. We can also use the **Ctrl+Enter** shortcut in Windows and Linux, or **Cmd+Enter** in Mac OS X to run the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Grid.** This is the part of the screen where the results of our queries are shown. We can also see the execution time of the query in the bottom bar. The results can be exported to different formats, such as CSV, JSON, XML, etc. by clicking on the **Export** button in the top bar. We can also edit the results by clicking on the **Edit** button in the top bar, or add new rows by editing the last (empty) row in the result grid. It is also possible to delete rows by selecting them and clicking on the **Delete** button in the top bar. Do not forget to click on the **Apply** button to apply the changes to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Panel.** This is the part of the screen where the output of the queries is shown. If we have syntax errors in our queries, the error will be shown here. We can also see the execution time of the query in the bottom bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **File Toolbar.** This is the top bar, where we can find the buttons to save our SQL files, or open SQL files in the editor. We can also find the buttons to execute the queries, export the results, edit the results, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install test databases\n",
    "Once you have installed MySQL and Workbench, you can install the test databases. You can download the test databases from this folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "[MySQL Test Databases](https://github.com/ffraile/computer_science_tutorials/tree/main/source/Databases/test_databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just download the file with the SQL code you would like to install, open it in workbench using the Open File button in the top bar, and execute the code by clicking on the lightning icon in the top bar. You can also use the **Ctrl+Enter** shortcut in Windows and Linux, or **Cmd+Enter** in Mac OS X to run the query as explained before. Before you run the code, read it through and make sure you know what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the Data Import menu. Go to Workbench, and in the Data Import, click on the 'Import from self-contained file', select the test database you want to import the data input, and click on **Start Import**. The following screenshot shows the process for the car_retail database:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MySQL workbench](./img/Database_Import.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you select the option 'Dump Structure and Data' to import the data as well. Once the import is completed, you can check that the database is available in the **SCHEMAS** tab in the left bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Code Extensions\n",
    "If you are using Visual Code, you can install the following extensions to work with MySQL:\n",
    "- [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools): This extension will allow you to manage connections to different databases, and execute queries from your visual code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SQLTools MySQL/MariaDB/TiDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools-driver-mysql): This extension will allow you to create connections to MySQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install them, just open the extensions tab in Visual Code, and search for the extension name. Click on install and you are ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a connection\n",
    "Once you have installed SQL Tools, you can create a connection to your database. Click on the SQLTools icon in the left bar (probably the last item in the menu), and click on the + icon to create a new connection. Select MySQL as the database type, and enter the connection details. The following screenshot shows the connection details for a local MySQL database:\n",

    "## Docker Playground\n",
    "The test environment in Docker Playground allows us to experiment with SQL using MySQL an [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker is becoming\n",
    "the industry standard for containerisation: a Technology that allows to easily and efficiently deploy applications\n",
    "using *lightweight virtual machines* called containers.\n",
    "In this practice, you will deploy two services (or microservices) in Docker Playground:\n",
    "- A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database service with the test databases in the test database folder.\n",
    "- A web administration interface, [adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then connect to the web interface of adminer to run your SQL queries.\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
