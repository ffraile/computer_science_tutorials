    "Follow the instructions, eventually you will be asked to select the encryption method. Select the \"Use Legacy\n",
    "Encryption\" method recommended for a test environment.\n",
    "You will also be asked to enter a password for the user root, enter a password for the service.\n",
    "When the installation is completed, you can launch the services control panel app to check whether your service is up\n",
    "and running, just look for \"Services\" in your language in windows and look for the MySQL service and make sure it is\n",
    "started. You may shut it down when you are not using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can look for and open Workbench in your system. You should have a connection to a local server:\n",

    "Enter the password you configured during the installation process and you are good to go!\n",

    "If you are using Visual Code, you can install the following extensions to work with MySQL:\n",
    "- [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools): This extension will allow you to manage connections to different databases, and execute queries from your visual code editor.\n",

    "#### Create a connection\n",
    "Once you have installed SQL Tools, you can create a connection to your database.
