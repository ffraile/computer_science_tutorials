    "# Practice Environment\n",
    "## Docker Playground\n",
    "The test environment in Docker Playground allows us to experiment with SQL using MySQL an [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker is becoming\n",
    "the industry standard for containerisation: a Technology that allows to easily and efficiently deploy applications\n",
    "using *lightweight virtual machines* called containers.\n",
    "In this practice, you will deploy two services (or microservices) in Docker Playground:\n",
    "- A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database service with the test databases in the test database folder.\n",
    "- A web administration interface, [adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then connect to the web interface of adminer to run your SQL queries.\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "For this environment you need an Internet connection and a **Docker hub account**. To create a Docker hub account, just\n",
    "go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), and sign up with a valid email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "Click on the button below to start the test environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Try in PWD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/test_databases/stack.yml)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Playground will ask for your Docker credentials to login. Once you enter your credentials, playground will be\n",
    "ready to start:\n",
    "\n",
    "![docker node ready](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/docker_start_button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click on start, Docker Playground will start building the services for the database and the adminer management\n",
    "frontend. The building process might take a while, so a bit of patience is needed at this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "![docker stack building](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/stack_builder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING**: When the building is done, a click button will appear. The click button might be a little bit tricky to click,\n",
    "depending on your browser. If you canÂ´t click it, you can just refresh the page and ignore the message.\n",
    "At this point you are able to access your docker environment in PWD. The easiest way to access it is to click\n",
    "on the **8080** link to the adminer frontend:\n",
    "\n",
    "![docker node ready](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/docker_node_ready.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you click on the link, you will access the adminer frontend, where you need to enter the credentials to connect to\n",
    "the MySQL service:\n",
    "- user name: root\n",
    "- password: mysql_is_awesome\n",
    "\n",
    "![login to adminer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/login_to_adminer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are in adminer, you can use its user interface to import the test database files and do the exercises. Just\n",
    "copy the raw contents of the test database you want to load and enter it in the *SQL Command* input text field:\n",
    "\n",
    "![create database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/command_sql.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can select the database, and click on *SQL Command* to enter again your search query.\n",

    "[SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/) is a simple yet powerful environment you can use to set up a test environment for\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "No requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "In the web interface, in the panel to the left, you need to enter the ```CREATE TABLE```\n",
    "and ```INSERT INTO``` statements to create your tables and insert your rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/sql_fiddle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To load a database into this panel, just copy the contents of the SQL file you want to test, paste the content of the\n",
    "file into the left panel and **delete** the `` CREATE DATABASE`` statements. For instance, for the car_retail test\n",
    "database, the page should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffraile/database_tutorials/master/img/sql_fiddle_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, click on the **Build Schema** button. The right panel should be now enabled. In this panel you can now enter your\n",
    "search queries and start fiddling with SQL:\n",

    "When the installation is completed, you can launch the services control panel app to check whether your service is up\n",
