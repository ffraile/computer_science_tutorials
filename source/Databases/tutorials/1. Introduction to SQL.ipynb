    "## Data Types\n",
    "Data elements in a relational database have a specific **type**, which is specified in the definition of the table where they are stored. As you will see below, each column in a table needs to have a type and a name, and the type definition needs to be supported by the specific database engine you are using. The sections below describe some data types widely used in **MySQL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In The type type syntax, types may use some optional parameters. For instance Integer numeric types use a parameter, *M* that indicates the maximum number of digits shown in the values returned by the engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections contain some relevant examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer\n",
    "A normal-size integer. The signed range is -2147483648 to 2147483647. The unsigned range is 0 to 4294967295.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers use **4** of storage space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT -- Normal Integer. At most 4294967296 different PersonIds\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Big Integer\n",
    "A big-size Integer. The signed range is -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. The unsigned range is 0 to 18446744073709551615.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Integers use **8** bytes of storage space. Alternatively, in MySQL, we can provide a parameter *M* that indicates the maximum number of digits shown in the values returned by the engine (it is worth noting that this is a MySQL specific feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```mysql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID BIGINT(20) -- Big integer with 20 digits. At most ~10^20 different PersonIds\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tiny Integer\n",
    "A tiny-size integer. A very small integer. The signed range is -128 to 127. The unsigned range is 0 to 255. A special case is  TINYINT(1), which is equivalent to a boolean variable. A value of zero is considered false. Nonzero values are considered true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiny Integers use **1** byte of storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT,\n",
    "    IsAwesome TINYINT(1) -- Either 0 (False) or 1 (True)\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decimal\n",
    "Fixed-point number. It has two optional parameters. M is the total number of digits (the precision) and D is the number of digits after the decimal point (the scale). The decimal point and (for negative numbers) the - sign are not counted in M. If D is 0, values have no decimal point or fractional part. The maximum number of digits (M) for DECIMAL is 65. The maximum number of supported decimals (D) is 30. If D is omitted, the default is 0. If M is omitted, the default is 10. Values for DECIMAL columns are stored using a binary format that packs nine decimal digits into 4 bytes. The storage requirements for the integer and fractional parts of each value are determined separately. Each multiple of nine digits requires 4 bytes, and any remaining digits left over require some fraction of 4 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT,\n",
    "    AwesomenessLevel DECIMAL(13,3) -- Decimal value with 13 digits of precision, up to 10^10 and with three digits after the decimal point\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Varchar\n",
    "VARCHAR are variables optimised to store variable-length character arrays or strings. The type is declared with a parameter *M* that indicates the maximum number of characters in a field. \n",
    "Each field will use a variable number of bytes, one per character in the string. For instance, a value of 'abc' will require 3 bytes and a value of 'ab' 2 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(30) -- Name with at most 30 characters\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enum \n",
    "ENUM is a special type of string variable, where the value can only take one of a set of values specified in the declaration of the type.\n",
    "The strings you specify as input values are automatically encoded as numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The storage space needed is **1 or 2 bytes** depending on the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT,\n",
    "    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') -- Either male, female, or other\n",
    "    );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timestamps\n",
    "The TIMESTAMP data type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. TIMESTAMP has a range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types and some considerations\n",
    "There are other data types both in standard SQL. For instance, the [Blob](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/blob.html) type and the [JSON](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json.html) type are two important types not covered in this basic tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to consider that each engine extends the standard with proprietary types with specific features. Each developer needs to consider the trade-offs of using each type. For instance, proprietary extensions limit the ability of your development team to change the database engine, so you may find yourself in a **vendor lock-in** situation where it is very expensive to change the engine to an alternative. So, as a rule, developers should choose standard types. However proprietary types can improve the efficiency of your development team (because they make things easier) or the performance of your application (because they make things better!). \n",
    "A DATETIME or TIMESTAMP value can include a trailing fractional seconds part in up to microseconds (6 digits) precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "  PersonID INT, \n",
    "  Created TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp when the record was created\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default values\n",
    "Each column can have a default value. If a new row is inserted into the table without specifying a value for a column, the column will take the default value. (We will see how to insert rows in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example defines a default value for each column except the ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Person (\n",
    "    PersonID INT, -- Normal Integer. At most 4294967296 different PersonIds.\n",
