Applied Mathematics
===================================
Welcome to this chapter on applied mathematics. This chapter contains notebooks and exercises that will help you solve
complex problems in engineering and management using applied mathematics. We will primarily use two popular libraries
named `Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `Scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_ to solve matrix algebra problems, differential equations, or other numerical problems. The Notebooks
in this section will cover the following topics:
