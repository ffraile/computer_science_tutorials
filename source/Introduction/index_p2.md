# Numerical Data Manipulation
Let us continue with our journey to learn the basics of computer programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/). 
In this chapter we will primarily focus on more advanced features to make your programs more efficient, focusing on 
numerical data manipulation. 

We are giving special attention to numerical data manipulation because it is the *raw material* used to build many engineering and management applications. 
In engineering, numerical data is the basis to optimize manufacturing and logistic processes, simulate fluid dynamics, or design mechanical structures. 
Traditionally, the complex models and calculations required to manipulate data were performed using calculators, or made by hand, 
but nowadays, the quality and safety of engineering solutions relies on computer programming almost entirely. 
In management, numerical data manipulation enables better decision-making through forecasting, risk assessment, and resource allocation. 
From financial modeling to inventory management, the capacity to quickly and accurately process numerical data is invaluable. 
Thus, mastering numerical data manipulation is a fundamental technical skill in both engineering and management contexts.
