# Introduction to Computer Programming: Part II
Let us continue with our journey to learn the basics of computer programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/). 
In this chapter we will primarily focus on more advanced features to make your programs more efficient. 

#### Objectives
The main **objectives** of this chapter are: 

üìÇ	Learn the concepts behind tabular data and how to use advanced data input and outputs in your programs.

üßÆ Get familiar with the Numpy library and how to use it to solve common management engineering and management problems.


#### üöÄ Are you excited about leveling up your game with Python? Let's go!
