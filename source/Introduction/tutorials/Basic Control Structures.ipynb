    "## Introduction\n",
    "In previous Notebooks, we covered the basics of the Structure Theorem. Recall that this is a very powerful theorem that states that we only need three different types of control structures (namely statements, selection, and repetition) to build any program! Also, in the last lecture, we covered Boolean variables (taking only values ```True``` or ```False```) and logical operators. In this Notebook, we will learn how to use this variables and operators to build basic control structures for selection (```if else```) statements and repetition (```while```) statement.\n",

    "## Basic features of Logical expressions and Boolean variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean variables are named after the great mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) who developed a symbolic language and operations to express complex logical expression and perform algebra and calculus operations. Back in the last days of the XIX century, mathematicians were divided into two groups. On one hand, there were those who believed that all mathematics could be derived from a set of basic axioms and using logical operators, like Boole. In this side were others like Gottlob Frege, who thought that logic could be used to model any aspect of reality, and developed the [Concept Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash). Definitely these are early (but prominent!) precursors of computer programming. On the other hand, there were those who believed that this fundamentalist vision was nonsense. With time, the former group of mathematicians devised computing machines specialised in binary logic and able to perform any mathematical operation, while the latter thought that this was just an illusion and that calculus and algebra were intrinsically too complex to be described just by logic. It is said that during the congress that took place in the International Exposition of 1900 in Paris, both groups had a harsh and intense debate. Later, other great mathematicians like Alan Turing took on the work of Boole and led the ground for modern day computer. [Logicomix: An Epic search of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix) is a delightful comic that vividly describes this journey. Now, looking backwards, one can only fear sorry for those that so fiercely debated against logic.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, back to computer programming, the main aim of logical expressions is to enable the use of logic to build complex processes. Basically, we will use logical expressions to evaluate conditions. The result of this evaluation will be a boolean variable with values either ```True``` or ```False```, and these results will control complex workflows through selection and repetition control structures (Boole would be so proud!).\n",
