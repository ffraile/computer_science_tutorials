    "Note that this page is a little bit different from the introduction, because it integrates two badges to open this page in two different interactive environments, Google Colabs and Binder. If you want to get familiar with these environments, please head to this [tutorial](./Jupyter%20Notebook%20Hello%20World.ipynb). In any case, for the remaining of this course, we will use Google Colabs, as a quick environment to get started with Python programminng and experiment with the code, but will use Visual Code Studio as our main development environment. So, now we will cover how to work with both environments.\n",

This will be the folder where you will store all the files for this course. For instance, you can name it `Computer Science`. Then, open Visual Studio and select the option to open a folder. Select the folder you have just created. You should see a screen similar to the one below.\n",

    "You can also execute your code by opening a terminal and typing `python hello-world.py`. This is how others could also execute your code, so it is a good idea to get familiar with this way of executing your programs. To open a terminal, click on the Terminal menu and select New Terminal. You will see a terminal window in the bottom panel, which you can use just as Power Shell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS). Now, just enter the command `python hello-world.pyÂ´, you should see the message \"Hello World\" in the output.\n",

If you want to learn more about the syntax of the documentation, head to our next tutorial on built-in functions.\n",
