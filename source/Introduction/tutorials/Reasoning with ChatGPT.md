# Reasoning with ChatGPT
## Introduction
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is a conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that can really step up your game in the world of programming, no matter what your current level is. In this Notebook we are going to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and how it can be used to help you with your programming problems. As the online book, this section focuses on beginner level exercises, but the same principles can be applied to more advanced problems.

One of the main goals of using AI assistance is to be practical and shift the focus from rote coding and theoretical knowledge to understanding the key concepts and how to apply them in real life.

We will be using the ChatGPT website to reason with the assistance and learn faster and better how to write code. In the very unlikely case that you are not familiar with the website, you can check the [ChatGPT website](https://chat.openai.com/) and the [ChatGPT blog post Transforming work and creativity with AI](https://openai.com/product) for more information.

Basically, this page provides few basic **prompt engineering** tips. A prompt is a piece of text that you provide to ChatGPT with instructions to produce the result you want. Entering a prompt in the chat will trigger a response from an AI model. Prompt engineering is the process of designing, curating, and storing for later use prompts that are very useful for a specific purpose. In this case, we are going to use prompts to reason with the AI model behind ChatGPT to help us learn how to code.

The combination of exercises and AI reasoning can be really powerful and in that sense, the following sections will provide some sample prompts that can help you use ChatGPT to adapt the learning rate to your specific needs. It will not only help you to get an answer, but also to understand the how and why behind it, which is invaluable for deeper learning and application.

## General tips for reasoning with ChatGPT

### Tip 1: Try the exercises first ü§î
Before you start using ChatGPT, try to solve the exercises first. This will help you understand the problem better and also give you a chance to think about the solution. Remember that, if you are stuck, you can always ask ChatGPT for help, but just the act of trying is already a big step forward in your learning process. Additionally, if you get an answer on your own, you can always ask ChatGPT to check it for you and give you feedback, tell you where you went wrong, or even give you a hint on how to solve it. So, don't be afraid to try and fail, because that is the best way to learn.

### Tip 2: Give ChatGPT some context üåç
It is important to give ChatGPT the right context about the field,  the subject, and your background.
Clearly, it is a really powerful tool and you can just copy the description of the problem and paste it into the chat window and ask for a solution in Python. However, it is important to give ChatGPT some additional context to help it understand the problem better and give you a more accurate answer. For example, if you are a beginner, you can tell ChatGPT that you are a beginner and that you are trying to learn how to code. This will help it understand that you are not an expert and that you need a more detailed explanation. On the other hand, you can also tell ChatGPT what are you studying so that it can better contextualize responses (for instance real-world application examples).

For instance, you can start a prompt with the following text:

<div class="admonition hint" name="html-admonition">
<p class="title">Sample Prompt</p>
I am a student of Engineering and Management and I am taking a course on Computer Programming with Python. The following exercises is part of the unit on Python built-in functions and I am trying to solve it: "Write a Python program to find the largest number among three input numbers provided by the user." Provide a solution in Python.
</div>


### Tip 3: Be specific üîç
Note that providing context does not mean that you have to write a whole lot of text. In fact, it is better to be as specific as possible. Following the example above, if you are trying to solve a problem, you can tell ChatGPT what you have tried so far and what you are stuck on. This will help it understand the problem better and give you a more accurate answer. For instance, you can complete the prompt with the following text:

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    I have tried to solve it by using the max() function, but I am not sure if it is the right approach. This is the code of my solution:

    num1 = input("Enter first number: ")

    num2 = input("Enter second number: ")

    num3 = input("Enter third number: ")

    largest = max(num1, num2, num3)

    print("The largest number is", largest)

    Tell me if the approach is correct and if so, fix the code for me. If the approach is not correct, please provide an alternative solution in Python.
:::

Normally, what really works for me is to provide high-level context in the first sentences and then very specific instructions in the last sentences.

### Tip 4: Deepen your understanding üå±
You do not need to stop at the answer, you can also ask ChatGPT to explain the answer to you. This will help you understand the problem better and also give you a chance to think about the solution. You can also ask for alternative solutions, relate to your field (Engineering and Management), or even ask for a real-world application example. For instance, you can continue reasoning with the following prompts:

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Can you explain step-by-step teh solution to me? Summarize what each line of code is doing.
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    What are the key programming concepts that I need to understand to solve this problem?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Are there any built-in functions or Python standard library tools that can make the solution easier?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Is there more whan way to solve this? Can you give me an alternative solution in Python?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    What are common pitfalls or mistakes to avoid in this type of exercise?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Why is this type of exercise important for my field (Engineering and Management)?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Can you give me a real-world application example of this type of exercise?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    I got this error message: "TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'". What does it mean and how can I fix it?
:::

After getting an answer or explanation, spend a moment reflecting on it and try to understand it. Compare the answers with other sources (for instance this book) and make sure the answer is consistent, or if you find anything that you would do differently according to other sources, reason with ChatGPT to understand why. This reflection process is very important for your learning process and will help you consolidate the knowledge you have gained.

### Tip 5: Test the knowledge you have gained üìù
You can use ChatGPT to test yourself, asking it to propose similar exercises, open analysis questions, and test questions. This will help you consolidate the knowledge you have gained and also give you a chance to think about the solution. For instance, you can continue reasoning with the following prompts:

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Can you propose a similar exercise for me to solve?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Can you propose five test questions related to the programming concepts used in the solution of this exercise for me to solve?
:::

:::{admonition} Sample prompt
:class: hint

    Can you propose five open analysis questions related to the programming concepts used in the solution of this exercise for me to solve?
:::

### Tip 6: Verify and cross-check ‚úÖ
It is always a good idea to test the code you have received from ChatGPT. You can do this by running the code in your computer and checking the results. For instance, you can just create a new Python file and paste the code you have received from ChatGPT. Then, you can run the code and check the results, or even better, create a [Jupyter Notebook](Jupyter%20Notebook%20Hello%20World.ipynb) to log your learning process and test the code (more on this later). You should also verify and double-check the information you receive, while the assistant is quite accurate, checking other sources will definitively help your comprehension and retention.

### Tip 7: Document Your journey üìî
Maintaining a journal or log where you save the prompts you find useful, the answers you received, and the code you have tested is a great way to document your learning process. This journal will serve as an excellent review material and help you reuse the prompts you found useful in previous lectures.

As a piece of advice, create your journal as a collection of Jupyter Notebook files. For instance, open in Collabs the class exercises file companion to each lecture and use it as a template of your coding journal. Then, you can add your prompts and the code you have received from ChatGPT and test it. Make sure you ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and also ask for questions and alternative problems (as per previous tips). Also, you can add your own notes and comments to the notebook. This will help you document your learning process and also create a great review material for your exams.

### Tip 8: Share your prompts üë´
You can share your prompts with your fellow students, particularly those that you find more interesting. As each one of you will have a different and personalized reasoning experience, your conversations will be different and sharing them with each other will help you learn faster and better.

I would also like to encourage you to share your prompts and responses you find interesting with your teachers. This will help them understand your learning process better and also give them a chance to provide you with additional feedback and guidance.
