    "## What are built-in functions?\n",
    "Python comes pre-stocked with an array of built-in functions (functions that are already defined in Python). They are part of the Python language itself and are always available, just waiting for you to use them. These functions are like your handy multi-tool - ready to help, whether you need to open a can, tighten a screw, or measure something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've just moved into a new home 🏚️. Imagine your new home comes pre-furnished with some essential items: a comfy bed, a spacious wardrobe, and maybe a well-stocked fridge to celebrate your house-warming party 🍾 . Python's built-in functions are just like these items - they're already there, ready for you to use. You don't have to go shopping to start enjoying your house!\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out what's in this toolbox, check out the 'IKEA catalogue' of Python's built-in functions in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). It's your one-stop-shop to discover all the tools Python offers right out of the box!\n",
    "\n",
    "To get ready to unpack the power of Python's built-in functions, your secret weapon in your journey of Python programming this tutorial includes some guidelines to read documentation and a cheat sheet to quickly access outstanding built-in functions 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to read documentation\n",
    "Let us take for example the built-in function `print()`. The documentation for this function can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print). At the time of writing, the documentation for this function looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False)\n",
    ">Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end, file, and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.\n",
    "> All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.\n",
    "> The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.\n",
    "> Output buffering is usually determined by file. However, if flush is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that's a lot of information! Let's break it down into smaller pieces. First, let us start with the function signature, which is the first line of the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function signature\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False)\n",
    "\n",
    " It tells us the name of the function, the arguments or parameters it takes, and the default values for those parameters. In this case, the function name is `print()`, it takes five parameters, which are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "#### Unnamed parameters\n",
    "The first parameter is noted as `*objects`. This means that the function can take any number of unnamed arguments. For instance, we can call the function with one argument `Hello World` like this:\n"

    "\n",

    "By using the name of the parameter, we can tell Python that this is not part of the unnamed parameters, but it is a named parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you tell the difference with the previous call? Exactly, `print` prints the *objects* passed as unnamed parameters, separated by a white space, which acts as the **separator**. The default separator can be changed using the `sep` parameter. Now, note that the documentation specifies that the default value of separator is a white space `sep=' '.\n",
