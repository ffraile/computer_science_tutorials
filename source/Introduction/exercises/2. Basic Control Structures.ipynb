For example, the number 9 is a multiple of 3, which is a previous odd number, so your script should not print 9. However, the number 11 is not a multiple of 3, so your script should print 11. The sequence should be 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.\n",

    "# Analysis Questions\n",
    "1. In exercise 1, what happens if the user inputs a temperature of 30ÂºC? Explain in your own words how would you modify the script to improve it.\n",
    "2. How could you take into account other weather conditions, such as rain or wind? Do you think that this solution is scalable? (scalable means that it can be easily modified to add more conditions)\n",
    "3. In exercise 3, what happens if the user inputs \"Thomas\" instead of \"thomas\"? Explain in your own words how could you use string built-in functions to make the script more robust. In this context, robust means that the script can handle different inputs and still behave as expected.\n",
    "4. In exercise 3, How could you count the number of attempts that the user needs to guess the name? Also, how could you give hints depending on the number of attempts?\n",
    "5. In exercise 5, how would you modify the code to reduce the number of iterations of the while loop? Explain in your own words how would you modify the script to improve it."
