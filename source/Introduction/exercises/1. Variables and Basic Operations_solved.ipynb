    "## Analysis questions\n",
    "1. In exercise 1, how does your program handle the complex variables ```x```and ```y```? What is the type of the variable ```z``` (motivate your response)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution uses Python syntax to define two complex variables, other alternatives are possible, for instance using the ```complex()``` function. The variable ```z``` is integer in the example, since the imaginary part of the complex numbers ```x``` and ```y``` are integers and the result of the addition is also a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In exercise 2, consider the case where the user enters a very large or very small temperature value. How might you modify the program to display the converted temperature in scientific notation or with a specific number of decimal places?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use formatted string literals to display the converted temperature in scientific notation or with a specific number of decimal places. For instance, to display the converted temperature in scientific notation we could use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"{farenheit:.2f} Fareinheit is equal to {celsius:.2f} Celsius\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In exercise 4, How can you tell if the genome sequence is not present in the genetic sequence? How can you handle this situation in your program?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```find()``` function returns -1 if the genome sequence is not present in the genetic sequence. We could modify the print message to inform the user that -1 means that thee genome sequence is not found, or use an ```if``` statement to handle this situation in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.In exercise 6, Explain in your own words how the bitwise operations work. Which of the two alternatives do you think is more efficient? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitwise shift operations are equivalent to multiplying or dividing by 2. The bitwise shift operations in general faster than the arithmetic operations, since they only require shifting the bits of the number, which is a much simpler operation than the multiplication or division of two numbers. However, the bitwise shift operations are only valid for integer, non-negative numbers, and the arithmetic operations are valid for any number. Also, arithmetic operations are more intuitive and readable than bitwise shift operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In exercise 6, How might you modify the program to allow the user to input a divisor other than 4? What considerations would you need to take into account when using bitwise shift operations for a different divisor?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use the ```input()``` function to allow the user to input a divisor other than 4. We would need to consider that the divisor must be a power of 2 if we want to use bitwise shift operations."
