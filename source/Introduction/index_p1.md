# Introduction 
Welcome to the first chapter of this book! In this chapter, we will cover the basics of computer programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

üêç Python is a very powerful programming language that is widely used in the fields of engineering and management. 
Python is also very popular for beginners because it is quite intuitive and easy to learn and use. 

#### Objectives
The main **objectives** of this chapter are: 

üìù Learn the key concepts of computer programming, like what is a programming language, and a computer program, and what 
are the main differences between natural languages and programming languages.

üëã Get familiar with Python development environments and learn how to write and run your first Python program.

üìò Learn the basics of Python syntax, what are comments, statements, variables, and how to use them, and how to perform basic operations with them.

üìë Learn what are control structures, and how to use them to control the flow of a program.
