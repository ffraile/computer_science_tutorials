Computer Programming for Engineering and Management
===============================================
Welcome to the *Computer Programming for Engineering and Management* interactive book! This project contains `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ with tutorials and exercises to learn basic computer programming skills for engineering and management.
The objective of this book is to help you learn the basics of computer programming and more specifically, to build a specific set of computer programming skills that are becoming increasingly important in any engineering and/or management position.
Below you can find a more detailed table of contents, but for now, let's keep in mind what are the main objectives of the book:

1. **Learn basic Python programming skills:** Here you will get familiar with the Python environment (what do you need to develop code and what you need to execute your code) and learn the basics of Python programming language.
2. **Learn the basics of modularization and object-oriented programming:** Here you will learn how to build your own functions, modules, and classes. If right now these terms are alien to you, then you are in the right place. Basically these are *less basic* computer programming features that will help make your code more efficient and easy to interpret by other collaborators.
3. **Applied mathematics in Python:** This chapter covers Python libraries to solve engineering and management problems using Python.
4. **Data manipulation and analysis:** Here you will learn how to handle data in Python. This is a basic data scientist skill, and nowadays there is a lot of data science embedded in other disciplines, and engineering and management are no exception! You will learn how to load data from formats and how to use modern Python libraries to analyze and visualize data.
5. **Data Management and Structured Query Language (SQL):** Here you will learn how to use the SQL language to query data in a database. This is a very powerful language, and although there are many different flavours and variations, most database engines used in in one way or another.
6. **Software engineering and software project management:** Here you will learn how to use the software engineering and project management tools to manage software projects. This is a very important skill, and you will learn how to use these tools to manage your code and your project.
7. **Distributed Computing**: Here you will learn about modern system architectures based on distributed computing. Terms like cloud and fog will no longer make you regret you left your umbrella home.

With this said, we are ready to get started! But before you do, I think it is important to emphasize that this is not a full-fledge computer programming book. It is an introductory book to the challenging computer programming world, meant for engineers and managers who want to use Python to solve problems, or that are involved in the development of software, for instance, providing specifications.

   - `Francisco Fraile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscofraile/>`_ "Hi, I am a senior researcher at the Research Center on Production Engineering and Management at UPV, and a passionate technomaniac who likes anything related to computer science. I teach computer science and operations research at EDEM and the main author of this book. I also like any sci-fi gender and I am prone to add easter eggs in my tutorials and exercises."
