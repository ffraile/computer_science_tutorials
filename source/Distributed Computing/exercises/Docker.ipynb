    "Throughout this page, we are going to make an introduction to some basic docker commands, which will allow us to understand how it works and to have a first contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch docker on your computer, without installing any software, you can use the website \"https://labs.play-with-docker.com/\". The only thing you will need is a docker account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will learn how to run a container, and explore the basics of how containers work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first container will be the Hello World container. To run it we need to make:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run hello-world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![hello-world](../img/hello-world.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the image the docker looked for the image called hello-world in the docker hub (since it was not downloaded), then it created a container from this image and sent us this message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can download another ubuntu image:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker image pull ubuntu\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](../img/pull-ubuntu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pull command retrieves the ubuntu image from the Docker registry and saves it to our system. We can use the docker image command to see the list of images on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the command \"docker image ls\" we can see the downloaded images on the system.\n",
    "![](../img/image-ls.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can launch a docker container based on this image. To do this, we must use the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker container run ubuntu ls -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](../img/run-ls.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call run, the Docker client finds the image, creates the container, and then runs a command on that container. When the docker container run ubuntu ls -l command is executed. Docker runs the ls -l command on the\n",
    "the ubuntu system. Once the ls command has finished, the container stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try entering the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker container run ubuntu echo \"hello from ubuntu\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command on our ubuntu container, and shut it down. This is all done very quickly, which is the big difference with a virtual machine, if we were to do this with a virtual machine we would have to boot the operating system, then launch the application, and enter the command, it would take 1-2 minutes to get the echo response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers work at the application layer, so they ignore most of the steps required by virtual machines and only run what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try another command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](../img/run-it.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this command you will be inside the running ubuntu container, it is like starting a virtual machine but only with the shell. To exit use the command \"exit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## My first docker service\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to install an Apache web server.\n",
    "First, we download the official apache httpd image.\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker pull httpd\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](../img/httpd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the apache container.\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -dit –-name server -p 80:80 httpd\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](../img/run_server.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters docker run:\n",
    "- -d = allow the container to run in the background\n",
    "- -i = allow the container to be interactive\n",
    "- -t = gives the container a terminal\n",
    "- --name = name of the container\n",
    "- -p = allows to map ports from inside the container 80:80 to outside the container 80:80. The port we used was 80 because it is the default port used by apache for non-secure connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/docker-ps-a-server.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We check that the apache server is working correctly by clicking on the mapped port.\n",
    "![](../img/Map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see the apache server serves us a page that shows a success message.\n",

    "## MariaDB in a container\n",
    "Before installing WordPress with Docker you will need to have somewhere to store the data. MariaDB is a community-developed relational database management system and a drop-in replacement for MySQL. Start off by making a new directory where you wish to store the files for WordPress and MariaDB for example in your home directory. Downloading and installing a new MariaDB container can all be performed with a single command. Before jumping in check the required parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "MariaDB Environment variables are marked in the Docker command with -e:\n",
    "- -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= Set your own password here.\n",
    "- -e MYSQL_DATABASE= Creates and names a new database e.g. wordpress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker parameters:\n",
    "- –-name wordpressdb –> Names the container.\n",
    "- -v \"PWD/database\":/var/lib/mysql –> Creates a data directory linked to the container storage to ensure data persistence.\n",
    "- -d – Tells Docker to run the container in daemon.\n",
    "- mariadb:latest –> Finally defines what to install and which version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress --name wordpressdb -v \"$PWD/database\":/var/lib/mysql -d mariadb:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If Docker was successful at creating the container, you should see a code at the end of the output similar to the example above.\n",

    "## WordPress\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications in containers run isolated from one another in the userspace of the host operating system sharing the kernel with other containers. This reduces the overhead required to run packaged software while also enabling the containers to run on any kind of infrastructure. To allow applications within different containers to work with one another Docker supports container linking.\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPress container also takes environment variables and Docker parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD= Set the same database password here.\n",
    "- -–name wordpress –> Gives the container a name.\n",
    "- –link wordpressdb:mysql –> Links the WordPress container with the MariaDB container so that the applications can interact.\n",
    "- -p 80:80 – Tells Docker to pass connections from your server’s HTTP port to the containers internal port 80.\n",
    "- -v \"PWD/html\":/var/www/html –> Sets the WordPress files accessible from outside the container. The volume files will remain even if the container was removed.\n",
    "- -d – Makes the container run on background\n",
    "- wordpress –> Tells Docker what to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/wordpressimage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the command below while replacing the password as you did for the MariaDB container.\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=root -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=password --name wordpress --link wordpressdb:mysql -p 80:80 -v \"$PWD/html\":/var/www/html -d wordpress\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then open your server’s domain name or IP address in a web browser to test the installation. You should be redirected to the initial WordPress setup page at http://<public IP>/wp-admin/install.php. Go through the setup wizard and you are done.\n",
    "![](../img/wordpressinstall.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an environment that allows us to quickly and easily deploy containers, which are nothing more or less than lightweight and modular virtual machines with which we can create an application in a matter of seconds. This technology has a large open source community that supports it and uploads a large amount of documentation on the subject. In addition, with Docker Hub we can have our favourite images uploaded to our personal repository and use them wherever we are."
