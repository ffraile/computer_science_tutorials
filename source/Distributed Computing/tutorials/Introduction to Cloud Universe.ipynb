    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the cloud is as popular as it is important within the enterprise. It is revolutionising all business sectors thanks to the savings generated by its on-demand use, ease of scalability and cost flexibility, allowing any company to offer technological competence while saving the cost of generating and deploying all the IT support it requires. These capital savings have enabled companies to leverage the cloud, taking advantage of the services to transform their businesses. Most enterprises have pragmatically adopted a hybrid cloud strategy. They are managing to use multiple public and private cloud services depending on business requirements. Within enterprises, IT departments can leverage data centres to deliver software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin our journey into the world of cloud by introducing some important concepts, reviewing some of the tools you need to know, including the basics you need to understand to move forward in the world of hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The first most important point is to understand the cloud ecosystem that we currently find in the market. This ecosystem can be divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consumers and services: All those everyday companies that use cloud services to carry out their business activities. These companies or businesses probably do not know very well where this service resides or how it is designed, but they do need these services to carry out their daily work.\n",
    "- Service provider: These are the companies that oversee managing all the infrastructure necessary to deploy and offer a service, application, or tool.\n",
    "- Service designer: These are companies that develop tools or applications designed to work in a specific architecture or cloud ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts of Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to cloud computing, enterprises can access shared computing resources, from applications, computing, development, storage, as well as different business processes. Cloud computing facilitates the use of computing resources by providing standardisation and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to *standardisation*, different services can be implemented while always maintaining a consistent set of interfaces, which facilitates their use and integration in a team. To achieve this, the cloud requires that all processes are implemented through a process of automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Automation* is triggered when business rule functions, availability of resources or security requirements are required, or specific rules are met. This allows the overall workload to be planned and managed, ensuring a self-service provisioning model. Likewise, when a provisioned service is no longer required, it returns all the resources involved in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most companies already use some form of cloud service, even if they don't think of it as such. For example, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, or Slack. These are cloud-based services that any company can use to communicate or back up data online in a commercial cloud. This also includes the commercial side, posting advertisements, using social networks (such as Twitter or LinkedIn). If the company is using a Google mail client (Gmail), it is also using cloud resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we must understand that cloud computing can mean that everything from business processes to IT infrastructure, to personal collaboration can be offered as a service; and to be operational for everyone, it must be implemented with common, standardised, and automated processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that clouds come in different types, depending on your needs. There is the public cloud, the private cloud, or the hybrid cloud. Most companies will use a hybrid cloud, where they will have a combination of private computing resources (data centre and private clouds) and public services, where some of the existing services in these environments interact with each other. In addition, many organisations use a variety of public cloud services to support different development and business units, which is called a multi-cloud environment. Multi-cloud has grown in popularity because developers want access to the platform of their choice, and businesses want the flexibility to move between providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "A private cloud is a set of hardware, services, applications, and interfaces that are deployed within the organization and used only by its employees, customers, or partners. This private cloud is not open to outside or other public consumption. The private cloud is usually highly automated, focusing on key points, such as security and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more and more platforms or companies that offer their cloud services to be deployed within a private datacentre within the company. These cloud solutions usually provide all the same services that are offered publicly, only oriented to private use. The provider of these services can manage and bill the customer in the same way they bill for public cloud usage, while keeping the data and workloads on-premises privately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "The public cloud is the set of hardware, services, applications, and interfaces that belong to an external company so that they can be used by an outside individual or company. These providers have scalable datacentres, which are unknown to the end consumer, both in terms of location and type of infrastructure.  The public cloud is viable because they are services that have a lot of resources that fit the needs of the applications to be executed.  Most public cloud providers offer a wide variety of APIs and services, such as security, specialized infrastructure to support specific workloads, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) for data science. All these cloud services are available on-demand, without multi-tenancy, within your datacentre. That is, you are allocated your own machines and storage within the cloud provider's datacentre. Although the workloads are physically isolated, at some point you will share some networks with other cloud customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybrid cloud and Multi-cloud model\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid cloud is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services where the two cloud environments work together to solve business problems. The goal is to create a hybrid cloud environment that can combine services and data from various cloud models to create a unified, automated, and well-managed computing environment. Multi-cloud is when two or more public clouds are used within an organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company has a Multi-cloud environment when there are different development teams using different public clouds. The combination of different public services with private clouds and the data centre is the definition of enterprise computing. Not every company that uses some public cloud services and some private cloud services has a hybrid or Multi-cloud. Rather, a hybrid or Multi-cloud cloud environment is when multiple public and/or private services are used together to create value.\n",
