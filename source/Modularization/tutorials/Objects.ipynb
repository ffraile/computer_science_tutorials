    "Object-oriented design, or Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which software is designed in terms of **real-world objects** and their relationships to one another. Recall that, as mentioned in the introduction, computer programming languages are intermediate or *proxy* languages between natural languages and machine code. With object-oriented programming, we create specific variables types called classes that define the properties and behaviours of concepts or objects in the scope of the problem that we are trying to solve with our program. For instance, think of a program to support the management of a course. Instead of relying exclusively on the built-in types provided by our programming language, imaging that we could have a type to model students, which would allow us to create a student by defining properties like the name and the age, just as we defined an imaginary number by defining the real part and the imaginary part, and then have methods to grade a student, or calculate the average grade of the student in an academic year. This would require the creation of a specific variable type (or class) for students, but in turn, it would allow us to code on a higher level of resemblance with the description of the problem in natural language, thus making our code easier to read and to maintain. After this introduction, let us established first the key concepts and terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**:  As mentioned, the definition of an object or concept is called class, and is equivalent to the concept of a variable type. By defining custom classes, we will be able to create or **instantiate** variables of that type.\n",
    "- **Object**: It follows that an object is an individual **instance** or individual entity or a class. For instance, in the example above, you would be an instance of the class student.\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Attributes model properties of a class of objects. Examples of attributes of the class student are name, surname, email address, etc.\n",
    "- **Methods**: Methods model actions or behaviors performed over an object, possibly based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image represents the relationship between these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Object Oriented Programming concepts with examples](img/OOP-examples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "The main benefits of using classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: The process of combining attributes (data) and methods (functions) into a single object is called encapsulation. The main benefit is that data or methods might not be accessible from the context where the class is instantiated, and we can keep some data or functions private. This gives and additional level of control when accessing the object. We will then refer to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Private access:** When data or functions can only be accessed within the class, from other class methods\n",
    "    - **Public access:** When data or functions can be accessed from external functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: We can create classes from other classes. This allows us to organise our code into different levels of abstraction, creating classes for more abstract concepts (for instance Person), and then extending these abstract classes to implement more concrete concepts (for instance Customer, or Employee). This allows us to hide implementation details when using a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Another benefit of creating classes from other classes is inheritance. We can implement common functionality in the parent class (Person) and reuse this functionality in the children classes (for instance, a send_email() method to send an email to a person, regardless if it´s a customer or an employee).This allows us to reduce redundant code, by implementing common methods and attributes in parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Another benefit that arises from the fact that we can create classes from other classes is that we can use the same method name to implement different functionalities in each child class. For instance, following the example above, both Customer and Employee classes could have an attribute called ```welcome_message``` with a welcome message text, but, although the concept is the same, the text can be different for customers than for employees. This allows to make our code more consistent and easier to read, by having common names for common concepts that can have different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of classes\n",
    "Let us now see how to create classes. Basically, what we need to do is to use the keyword ```class``` followed by the name of the class that we want to create, and then, within the class definition, use the ```def``` keyword to add methods to our class. Let us see an example and then explain the syntax."
