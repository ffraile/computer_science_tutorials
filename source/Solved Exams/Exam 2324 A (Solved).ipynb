    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_message = input(\"Enter a binary sequence: \")\n",
    "print(user_message[::-1])\n",

    "**a.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the sequence ```101010```? Explain why. **(1 point)**\n",
    "The output is 010101 because the [::-1] reverses the string.\n",

    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_name = \"Thomas\"\n",
    "your_guess = \"\"\n",
    "max_attempts = 5\n",

    "print(\"You needed \" + str(counter) + \" attempts to guess my name\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your words what the program does? **(1 point)**\n",
    "The program asks the user to guess the name \"Thomas\". If the user guesses correctly, the program ends. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program gives a clue and asks the user to guess again. The clues consist of the first letter(s) of the name, the first clue is \"T\", and if the user needs a third attempt, the clue is \"Th\", and so on. The program ends after 5 attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the name ```Luke```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "No, that is not my name!\n",
    "Here´s a clue, my name starts with T\n",
    "Try again!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "all_chars = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!?.:,'{}[]+-*/=_@#$%^&()~\"\n",

    "    p_string = p_string + all_chars[a_random_idx]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And recall that the function ```random.randint(a, b)``` returns a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive), and the function ```range(a)``` returns an iterable object that contains all integers from 0 to `a-1` (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your own words what the code does. What would you use this code for? **(2 points)**\n",
    "The code asks the user for a integer value, and then creates a random string of characters with the length of the integer value provided by the user. The code could be used to create for instance a random password.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",

    "        c_list.append(a_list[i] + b_list[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And recall that the method ```list.append(x)``` adds the element `x` to the end of the list ```list```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** What is the value of the variable c_list at the end of the program? **(2 points)**\n",
    "The value of c_list is [2, 6, 10, 14, 18].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = int(input(\"Enter an integer number: \"))\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "result = \"\"\n",
    "while x > 2**i:\n",
    "    b = (x // (2**i)) % 2\n",
    "    i = i + 1\n",

    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** What does the program do? **(1.5 points)**\n",
    "The program asks the user for an integer number, and then converts the number to a string representing the value of the number in binary.\n",

    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the number 10? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "1010\n",

    "### Exercise 6\n",
    "Check the following dictionary:\n",
