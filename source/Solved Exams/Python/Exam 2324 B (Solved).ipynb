    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_number = float(input(\"Enter a number\"))\n",
    "if input_number > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive\")\n",
    "elif input_number < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** What does this program do? Explain with your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This program takes a number from the user and prints whether it is positive, negative or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "Review the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = input(\"Enter some text: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "text_2 = text[::-1]\n",
    "if text == text_2:\n",
    "    print(\"True!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No luck this time...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your words what the program does? **(1.5 points)**\n",
    "This program takes a string from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, considering commas, spaces, and capital letters. For instance, the input text \"hello\" will result in the program printing \"No luck this time...\" while the input text \"racecar\" will result in the program printing \"True!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the text ```A man, a plan, a canal, Panama```? Explain why **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "The output of the program is \"No luck this time...\". Although the text is a palindrome, the program does not consider commas and spaces, it just compares the text to the reverse of the text, and \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\" is not the same as \"amanaP ,lanac a ,nalp a ,nam A\", although reading the latter backwards results in the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "Check the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "result = 1\n",
    "while input_number > 1:\n",
    "    result = result * input_number\n",
    "    input_number = input_number - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your own words what the code does. What would you use this code for? **(2 points)**\n",
    "This code takes a number from the user and calculates the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For instance, the factorial of 4 is  4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the number 5? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the program is 120.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "Review the program below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flame = \"ðŸ”¥\"\n",
    "ice_cube = \"ðŸ§Š\"\n",
    "\n",
    "current_temperature = float(input(\"What is the temperature? \"))\n",
    "difference = current_temperature - 23\n",
    "no_of_emojis = round(abs(difference))\n",
    "if difference > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"ItÂ´s hot! \" + flame * no_of_emojis)\n",
    "elif difference < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"ItÂ´s cold! \" + ice_cube * no_of_emojis)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The temperature is perfect!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Recall that the built-in function ```round``` rounds a number to the nearest integer. For example, ```round(3.5)``` returns ```4```, and the function ```abs``` returns the absolute value of a number. For example, ```abs(-3)``` returns ```3```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** What does the program do? Explain in your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "This program asks the user for the current temperature and prints a message with emojis depending on the difference between the current temperature and 23 degrees. If the temperature is higher than 23 degrees, the program prints \"ItÂ´s hot!\" followed by a number of flame emojis equal to the difference between the current temperature and 23, rounded to the closest integer. If the temperature is lower than 23 degrees, the program prints \"ItÂ´s cold!\" followed by a number of ice cube emojis equal to the difference between the current temperature and 23, again rounded to the nearest integer. If the temperature is exactly 23 degrees, the program prints \"The temperature is perfect!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the number 27? **(1 point)**\n",
    "The output of the program is the text \"ItÂ´s hot! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥\" (obviously it refers to 27 degrees Celsius, not Fahrenheit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "Check the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [2, 7, 4, 9, 12, 5, 15]\n",
    "for num in sorted(numbers, reverse=True):\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the function ```sorted``` returns a sorted list of the elements in the list passed as argument. The argument ```reverse=True``` indicates that the list should be sorted in descending order (from largest to smallest).\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** What does the program do? Explain in your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "This program prints all the even numbers in the list numbers in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the sequence printed by the program? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "The sequence printed by the program is 12, 4, 2 (one number per line).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 5,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 6\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Bob\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 8,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 7\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Charlie\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 7,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 8\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Diana\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 6,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 6\n",
    "        }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the method ```dict.values()``` returns a list of the values in a dictionary. For example, ```{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}.values()``` returns ```[1, 2]```.\n",
    "Recall that the function ```sum``` returns the sum of the elements in a list. For example, ```sum([1, 2, 3])``` returns ```6```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a** What is the output of the following statement ```print(students[\"Alice\"][\"CS\"])```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "The output of the statement is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b** What is the type of the value returned by the following statement ```Students[\"Bob\"]```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "The value returned is a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c** What is the output of the following statement ```print(sum(students[\"Bob\"].values())/2)```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "The output of the statement is 7.5."
