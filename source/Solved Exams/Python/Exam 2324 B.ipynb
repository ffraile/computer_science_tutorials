    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_number = float(input(\"Enter a number\"))\n",
    "if input_number > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive\")\n",
    "elif input_number < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** What does this program do? Explain with your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "Review the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = input(\"Enter some text: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "text_2 = text[::-1]\n",
    "if text == text_2:\n",
    "    print(\"True!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No luck this time...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your words what the program does? **(1.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the text ```A man, a plan, a canal, Panama```? Explain why **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "Check the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "result = 1\n",
    "while input_number > 1:\n",
    "    result = result * input_number\n",
    "    input_number = input_number - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** Describe in your own words what the code does. What would you use this code for? **(2 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the number 5? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "Review the program below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flame = \"ðŸ”¥\"\n",
    "ice_cube = \"ðŸ§Š\"\n",
    "\n",
    "current_temperature = float(input(\"What is the temperature? \"))\n",
    "difference = current_temperature - 23\n",
    "no_of_emojis = round(abs(difference))\n",
    "if difference > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"ItÂ´s hot! \" + flame * no_of_emojis)\n",
    "elif difference < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"ItÂ´s cold! \" + ice_cube * no_of_emojis)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The temperature is perfect!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Recall that the built-in function ```round``` rounds a number to the nearest integer. For example, ```round(3.5)``` returns ```4```, and the function ```abs``` returns the absolute value of a number. For example, ```abs(-3)``` returns ```3```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** What does the program do? Explain in your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the output of the program if the user enters the number 27? **(1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "Check the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [2, 7, 4, 9, 12, 5, 15]\n",
    "for num in sorted(numbers, reverse=True):\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the function ```sorted``` returns a sorted list of the elements in the list passed as argument. The argument ```reverse=True``` indicates that the list should be sorted in descending order (from largest to smallest).\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** What does the program do? Explain in your own words **(1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** What is the sequence printed by the program? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 5,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 6\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Bob\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 8,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 7\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Charlie\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 7,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 8\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    \"Diana\": {\n",
    "        \"CS\": 6,\n",
    "        \"Math\": 6\n",
    "        }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the method ```dict.values()``` returns a list of the values in a dictionary. For example, ```{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}.values()``` returns ```[1, 2]```.\n",
    "Recall that the function ```sum``` returns the sum of the elements in a list. For example, ```sum([1, 2, 3])``` returns ```6```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a** What is the output of the following statement ```print(students[\"Alice\"][\"CS\"])```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**b** What is the type of the value returned by the following statement ```Students[\"Bob\"]```? **(0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**c** What is the output of the following statement ```print(sum(students[\"Bob\"].values())/2)```? **(0.5 points)**"
