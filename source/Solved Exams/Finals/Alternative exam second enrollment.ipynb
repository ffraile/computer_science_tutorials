    "Consider the following requirements for a database that keeps track of movies and series in a streaming service named EDEMFlix, similar to Netflix, but with exclusive content for engineers and managers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **items**: We refer to movies or series episodes as items. Each item (movie or serie episode) has a title, a genre, a release year, and a rating (e.g., PG-13, R, etc.).\n",
    "- **Series**: A series is a collection of episodes. Each series has a title, a genre, a release year, and a rating.\n",
    "- **Cast Members**: Each item (movie or serie episode) has a cast. Each cast member has a different role.\n",
    "- **Technical Crew Members**: Each item (movie or serie episode) has a technical crew. Each technical crew member has a different role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many to many relationships between items and cast members, and between items and technical crew members. For example, a movie can have many cast members, and a cast member can be in many movies. The same applies to series and cast members, and series and technical crew members.\n",
