    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "A restaurant wants to implement a database to manage table reservations, customer orders, and their menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables in the restaurant are identified by table numbers and have varying capacities. Customers can make reservations, providing their names, contact details, and the date and time for their reservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The menu consists of dishes, each with a unique identifier, name, category (e.g., appetizer, main course), and price. Orders keep track of what dishes were ordered by each table, the quantity of each dish, and the total price of the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a database schema that will allow the restaurant to manage reservations and orders efficiently, capturing all relevant information and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible solution is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![La Paella Restaurant](../../Databases/Extra%20Exercises/img/la_paella_restaurant..png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution uses a many-to-many relationship between the ```orders``` and ```menu``` tables. This is because each order can contain multiple dishes, and each dish can be part of multiple orders. The ```order_items``` table is a junction table that connects the two tables. The total price of each order is stored in the ```orders``` table, and the quantity of each dish is stored in the ```order_items``` table. This design avoids storing redundant information in the ```menu``` table. We could have additional columns in the ```order``` table, like the tip, or the level of satisfaction. The colum ```order_date``` is also included, although it is not part of the requirements. It is however a good practice and it is useful for the restaurant to know when the order was made.\n",
